"""Welcome to the turtle printer game! This is an easy way to get into some basic coding, or just to have a bit of fun.

In the box on the left, you can write code. You can then use the "Run Code" button to see the results of your code on the right hand side.

This game lets you code in a language called Python. You can use Python to give commands to a "turtle" which will draw pictures for you.

Give it a try! Enter "turtle.forward(100)" into the code box on the left and hit "Run Code" to see the turtle draw you a line."""
