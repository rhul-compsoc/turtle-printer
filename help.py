"""Welcome to the turtle printer game! This is an easy way to get into some basic coding, or just to have a bit of fun.

In the box on the left, you can write code. You can then use the "Run Code" button to see the results of your code on the right hand side.

This game lets you code in a language called Python. You can use Python to give commands to a "turtle" which will draw pictures for you.

Give it a try! Enter "turtle.forward(100)" into the code box on the left and hit "Run Code" to see the turtle draw you a line.""",
"""Making a line is pretty cool, but all good drawings need more than one line.

To add more drawing commands to your program, add them in order on a new line. For example, to draw a square, you can try:
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(100)

This will cause the turtle to make 4 identical lines, turning 90 degrees between each one.
""",
"""You may be wondering what the numbers in our commands mean. These numbers are called "arguments", and they specify a number relative to the command.

For example, turtle.forward(100) means "move the turtle forward 100 units". Likewise, turtle.right(90) means "turn the turtle right 90 degrees".

Try changing the arguments in your program and see what it does to your shape
""",
"""You will hopefully now understand the basics of programming your Turtle in Python. You can now try to use these commands to make a drawing of your own!

Here are some turtle commands you may find helpful:
turtle.forward(<distance>)
turtle.backward(<distance>)
turtle.right(<angle>)
turtle.left(<angle>)
turtle.circle(<radius>)
turtle.penup()
turtle.pendown()

See what you can come up with by combining these commands. You can continue this help turotial for some more advanced Python concepts if you wish.
